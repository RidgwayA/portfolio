        With a background in both business and software development, I bring a
        unique blend of analytical thinking, technical expertise, and
        customer-focused solutions. My career started in banking, where I
        developed strong financial and problem-solving skills before
        transitioning into software engineeringâ€”a passion that drives me to
        create efficient and user-friendly solutions. Over the past five years,
        my wife and I have embarked on an incredible journey, traveling across
        the country as she worked as a travel CT tech, moving 10+ times with our
        two dogs, Nala and Max. While our nomadic lifestyle has been an
        adventure, we are now looking to settle down and build a more permanent
        foundation. With experience in banking, rental property management,
        software development, and IT infrastructure, I am eager to apply my
        skills in a role that allows me to create meaningful and innovative
        technology solutions.
