        As an entry-level developer with a strong foundation in Java, Python,
        React, and Spring Boot, I am passionate about building efficient and
        user-friendly applications. My background in business and banking,
        combined with my software development degree, gives me a unique
        perspective in problem-solving, team collaboration, and delivering
        solutions that meet both technical and business needs. I am eager to
        apply my skills in web development, database management, and cloud
        computing while continuously learning and growing as a developer.
