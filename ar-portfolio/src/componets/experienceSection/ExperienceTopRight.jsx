        With a strong background in customer service, financial operations, and
        property management, I bring a unique blend of analytical,
        organizational, and leadership skills to every role I pursue. My
        experience managing rental properties has sharpened my problem-solving
        abilities and business acumen, while my work in banking and retail has
        built my foundation in client relations, process management, and team
        collaboration. With a growing technical skill set from my software
        engineering studies and certifications, I am prepared to leverage my
        diverse experience to drive results and contribute meaningfully to
        technology-driven teams.
